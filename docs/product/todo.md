guild war history, tooltip shows top let, and teleports to graph
guild war history, from and to time range selector looks weird
guild war history, localization not fullly completed
event page, show first 10 members signed up, hide rest behind +n that shows after click
dashboard page remove featureed events
dashboard page, it should show last guild war that happened
controls are clipped with each other, some before hover some after.
event page, filer buttons doesnt actually work,
guild war page, change sort buttons to sort both ways
guild war page, change double click to show a profile like the one in profile/admin view, the double click detail shouldnt be visible to external and normal members.
lots of the pages are still partially localized.
roster page, clicking on member does not open detail modal
guild war page, show pool/register like a team, where it is header + box of members
